My ture first java program written with JDK and Eclipse

This is a java program that performs converting character encodings between EBIDIC and Big-5.
To use it, it must be given the encoding information to build a look-up table.
The format to store the information is shown in the example file "CHINESECODE".
Environment: JDK 1.8.0_u111 and Eclipse 4.6.1
